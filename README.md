# Multiplayer Raycaster Engine  
### Flask • HTML Canvas • Online Multiplayer

A **Flask-based web application** hosting an **optimised online multiplayer 3D raycaster engine** built entirely on an **HTML Canvas** renderer.

The project combines a **high-performance client-side engine**, real-time multiplayer networking, and a **secure, API-driven backend**, designed for responsiveness, scalability, and low memory overhead.

---

## 🎮 Overview

This platform delivers a classic raycasting-style 3D engine with modern features:

- Smooth 60 FPS client tick
- Multiplayer world replication
- Modular engine architecture
- Secure, production-ready backend
- REST-driven services and asset pipelines

The system is designed to run efficiently in-browser while supporting multiple concurrent players.

## 🧠 Engine Design

### Core Principles
- Modular architecture
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Minimal shared resources between client and server
- Explicit update and render pipelines

---

### ⏱️ Order of Operations

1. **Client Tick (Target: 60 FPS)**
2. Input Processing
3. Physics & Collision Resolution
4. Camera Update
5. Raycasting & Wall Projection
6. Lighting & Shader Application
7. UI Rendering
8. Network Sync

Some effects are intentionally capped at **30 FPS** to reduce processing cost.
